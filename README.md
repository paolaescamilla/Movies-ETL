# Movies-ETL

The analysis presented in this repository is putting in practice the ETL process.

The analysis starts with the identification of the content in three different data sets. Then, the data is cleaned and adequated in similar columns between the three data sets in order to merge them and systemize them into a whole one. Lastly, the new dataframe is extracted in a new file which is now unified on its content for further use.
